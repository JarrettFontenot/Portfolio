            <h1>I am a software engineer.</h1>
            <br />
            <p>As a backend software engineer, I specialize 
               in architecting efficient and scalable backend solutions. 
               With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas State, and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University, 
               I excel in optimizing performance and tackling complex challenges in system architecture. 
               My passion lies in leveraging software to solve real-world problems, driving me to push the 
               boundaries of backend development with each project.</p>
